# Data Analysis Portfolio Project

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on various datasets, with a specific emphasis on a movie dataset sourced from Kaggle's public datasets.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze factors influencing a movie's success in terms of gross revenue. Python was used as the primary programming language, and the following libraries were instrumental in conducting the analysis:

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis.
- `data/`: Holds the datasets used in the analysis.
- `results/`: Includes any relevant result files or visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed before running the notebooks:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn numpy matplotlib
